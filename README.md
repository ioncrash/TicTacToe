Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game!

Here's a link to the game hosted on GitHub:

For this project I used:

Git, GitHub, Atom, JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, a Ruby on Rails server, a grunt server, and tested my code using Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

I started this project by making some wireframes which you can take a look at here:

Obviously the game doesn't look much like that now. I decided to follow the path that a user would follow, and I made some user stories, which I wrote down here:

As a player, I want to find my friends so that I can play against them.
As a player, I want to look up my past stats so that I can see how much time I've wasted.
As a player, I want to change my password so that I can keep my exboyfriend out of my account.
As a player, I want to sign in and out so that my new games are added to my history.

I decided to start where a user would start, with functions to sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out.

This is where I ran into most of my problems, especially with getting the api data to store correctly on a local machine. My strategy to solve problems was to place lots of debuggers and check to see if the data was returning in the correct form. If that didn't help, I would first ask if anyone around me was having a similar problem, and then to run a google search for similar issues people had had in the past. I also used the closed issue threads for one or two problems. As the project went along I got much better at debugging problems in the console, and also at reading documentation.

In the future, I'd like to have my get stats function return games won and lost, not just total games played. I'd also like to have better visuals, maybe with some images. These colors are nice and clean, but they're not pretty.
